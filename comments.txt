Automatic classification of MR scans in Alzheimer's disease

limitations: the SVN can only distinguish between two classes. In order to distinguish between more classes a multi-SVN approach needs to be considered
motion was not considered (Seb). 


Seb's comments: 
1. one of the biggest advantages/selling points about the paper that patients were postmortemly identified as AD (which is why it got accepted into Brain)
2. paper is fantastic
3. title should be "ML classification of abnormal scan" (not 100% sure, but abnomal keyword was there, Seb) 
4. classifying on more classes (other dementias such as schizophrenia) is crucial. If a schizophrenic patient is included in the sample it might be picked up as AD, although it doesn't have AD at all.
5. the research field evolved since 2008. Now people look into classifying various varieties of AD up to small granularities
6. At the time the paper was using sophisticated algorithms (the normalisation technique, Ashburner 2007)
7. biggest point: the first data-driven approach for this
8. It is remarkable that a methods paper like this got published into Brain(they only take a few methods papers each year)
9. The normalisation technique is based on Least Squares, which is very sensitive to initial conditions
10. The modulation step: for having 100% amyloid-beta detection
